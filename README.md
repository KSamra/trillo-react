# Trillo

## Description

A landing page for a fictional company named Trillo. Built with react and styled using styled-components. My main goal with this project is just to get better with CSS and to try out the styled-components library to see how it compares to using CSS modules.

## How to Run

Just clone the repo and run `npm install` to download the necessary dependencies. After that, run `npm start` to run the application.
