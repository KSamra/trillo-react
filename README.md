# Trillo

## Description

A landing page for a fictional company named Trillo. Built with react and styled using styled-components. My main goal with this project is to get better with CSS and to try out the styled-components library to see how it compares to using CSS modules. Since the goal is design over functionality, many of the rendered values are not being received from an external API, rather they are chosen directly. Since this is the case, this page is not very interactive, however the point of this project is purely about getting good at design so that future projects will look great and function great :)

## How to Run

Just clone the repo and run `npm install` to download the necessary dependencies. After that, run `npm start` to run the application.
